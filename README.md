## dunhill_toarcian
Code to Reproduce Dunhill et al analysis of secondary extinctions in Toarcian food webs, submitted to Nature Ecology and Evolution for review.

The project should be initiated with `dunhill_toarcian.Rproj`.
There is a Scripts and Data folder

### Data Files

    - ToarcianWebs_Guild_May2021.RData - core input data of Toarcian Network
    - wrkWebs_allSeqs.RData - output from GenerateExintctionSequences (can be recreated with set.seed()) and used (loaded) in AnalyseToarcianNetworks.
    - metrics_time2.csv - details among times slices on network metrics
    - metrics_time.csv - details among times slices on network metrics

### Helper Scripts/Function Scripts

1. `pfwim.R` - contains several functions to estimate network metrics and motifs
2. `GenerateExtinctionSequences.R` - 
    - defines traits; 
    - defines random stratfied samples of traits from core network; 
    - defines function to implement secondary extinction cascades via primary extinctions from b using cheddar RemoveNodes() function; 
    - collects networks and extinction sequences.

### Visualisation of networks in 3D - produces Fig 1

1. `MakeCompositeFigure.R`

### Analysis of secondary exinction scenarios - Produces Figure 2a,b.

1. `AnalyseToarcianNetworks.R` - estimates several structural metrics, motifs and True Skill Statistic from simulated networks.  

### Analysis of network structure through time - Produces Figure 2c,d.

1.`guild network metric plotting.R` accesses combined data generated by `GuildWebsBuildPlotAnalyse.R` in Reference-Scratch

## Make Composite Fig 2a-d
1. `MakeCompositeFigure.R` - uses patchwork in R to combine figures
